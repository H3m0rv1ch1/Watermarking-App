# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

- We actively support the latest main branch and the most recent release.
- Older releases may receive critical fixes at maintainers’ discretion.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for security reports.

- If GitHub Security Advisories are enabled, use them to submit a private report.
- Otherwise, contact the maintainers privately (via repository contact details).
- If no private channel is available, create a minimal issue titled "Security Report" without details and request a private contact; we will respond promptly.

### Disclosure Guidelines

- Provide steps to reproduce, impact, and any suggested remediation.
- Avoid sharing sensitive data or credentials.
- We aim to acknowledge receipt within 72 hours and provide an initial assessment within 7 days.

## Best Practices for Contributors

- Do not commit secrets, tokens, or personal data.
- Validate and sanitize inputs when adding new features.
- Keep dependencies up to date and avoid unsafe packages.
